🚢 Ahoy, captain! Welcome aboard **Battleships**, the ultimate naval combat game. ⚔️💥 You'll need to use all your wits and strategy to outmaneuver and outgun your opponent.

It's a classic battleships game based on the pencil and paper version. 📝
Each player receives a game board and five ships of varying lengths. Each ship has parts.
The five ships are:

<li>Carrier 🛬, which has five parts</li>
<li>Battleship 🚀, which has four parts</li>
<li>Cruiser 🛳️, which has three parts</li>
<li>Submarine 🚤, which has three parts</li>
<li>Destroyer ⚓, which has one part</li>
<br><br>

💥🎯 Once all the ships are placed, the shooting phase begins. Take turns calling out coordinates to attack, using your strategic skills to hit your opponent's ships and sink them.
<br><br>

🏆 The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game and becomes the ultimate commander of the seas! 🌊
<br><br>
